Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from
files called `Makefile.am'.
The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance
from the back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back
of the Automake maintainer).
The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions
(with rules being thrown in occasionally).  The generated
`Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.
Automake 1.16 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake
1.11, and 1.15 did, so some previous versions are available as separate
packages.
